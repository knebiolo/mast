If initial_state_release is set to True, a state (state: 0) is added to the model.  Therefore it is possible to model movement from the release location as well as determine fall back.  If last_presence_time0 is set to True, the last detection at the initial receiver is used as the starting time for the analysis of movement.  When modeling migratory movement of American Shad for example, adult fish can survive spawning.  Thus it can be recaptured at the same reciever on its way up and down.  If you are modeling downstream movement, you want to model movement from when it was last at the most upstream receiver.  Cap_loc and rel_loc are optional arguments that will filter the data in the model so it only looks at specimens at specific capture and release locations.  And finally, the species argument restricts model creation to a single species if more than 1 were tagged in your study."

    "Then we perform data preparation.  When the time_dependent_covariates = True, MAST creates an output file that can be joined to time series data.  The bucket_length_min argument specifies the number of minutes between each time series observation.  Unknown_state places fish into a new 'unknown' state if they went missing before they reached their goal by the studies completion. Overlap may still exist between receivers and adjacency_filter removes those movements that still may exist.  This commonly happens when forebay receivers pick up fish in the tailrace.  When looking at transitions it appears that a fish has moved from the tailrace to the forebay.  To the algorithm, the forebay detections look like real detections, but when we model movement they must be removed.  The relationships in the filter specify the parent:child relationshp or to:from movements that are illegal."
