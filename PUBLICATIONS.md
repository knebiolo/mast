## 📄 Methods & Software Papers

### Primary Citation

**Nebiolo, K.P., & Castro-Santos, T. (2024).** MAST: Movement Analysis Software for Telemetry data. Part I: the semi-automated removal of false positives from radio telemetry data. *Animal Biotelemetry*, 12(1), 11.  
📊 https://doi.org/10.1186/s40317-024-00358-1

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the PyMAST framework and validates the Naive Bayes classifier approach for false positive detection in radio telemetry data.

**Key Findings:**
- Naive Bayes classifier achieves >95% true positive retention
- Reduces manual review time by 80-95%
- Validated across multiple study systems and receiver types

## 📖 How to Cite PyMAST

### For Methods Papers

If describing the false positive removal approach:

```
We used the Naive Bayes classifier approach implemented in PyMAST 
(Nebiolo & Castro-Santos, 2024) to identify and remove false positive 
detections from radio telemetry data.
```

### For Software Citation

In your Methods or Acknowledgments section:

```
Data processing was conducted using PyMAST v1.0.0 (Nebiolo & Castro-Santos, 
2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.XXXXX).
```
