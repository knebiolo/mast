    "## 🎯 What This Notebook Does\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through analyzing your radio telemetry data from start to finish. **No programming experience required!** Just follow along, update the values in CAPITAL LETTERS with your own information, and press the \"Run\" button (▶️) on each cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Accomplish:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Load your project** - Connect to your fish tracking data\n",
    "2. **Import receiver files** - Bring in detection data from the field\n",
    "3. **Clean the data** (optional) - Remove false detections using AI\n",
    "4. **Find fish visits** - Identify when fish were at each location\n",
    "5. **Resolve overlaps** - Handle fish detected by multiple receivers\n",
    "6. **Export for analysis** - Create files for statistical software\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Required: \n",
    "- **First time**: 2-4 hours (depending on data size)\n",
    "- **Repeat sessions**: 5-10 minutes (just run setup cells)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💾 What You Need Before Starting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a folder on your computer with these files:\n",
    "- `tblMasterTag.csv` - Information about your fish tags (tag IDs, pulse rates, etc.)\n",
    "- `tblMasterReceiver.csv` - Information about your receivers (receiver IDs, locations)\n",
    "- `tblNodes.csv` - Locations/areas you're studying (optional)\n",
    "- A folder called `Data` with a subfolder `Raw_Files` containing your receiver download files\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📖 How to Use This Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read the text in each section** - It explains what's happening\n",
    "2. **Look for 🔧 EDIT THIS** markers - These tell you what to change\n",
    "3. **Click the cell and press Shift+Enter** - This runs the code\n",
    "4. **Wait for the ✓ checkmark** - This means it worked!\n",
    "5. **If you see an error** - Read it carefully, it usually tells you what's wrong\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Pro Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run cells in order** - Don't skip around or things will break\n",
    "- **Save often** - Use Ctrl+S or File → Save\n",
    "- **You can't break anything permanently** - The database keeps backups\n",
    "- **Green text starting with #** - These are comments, just notes for you\n",
    "- **Lines starting with #** - Won't run, they're turned off (you can turn them on by removing the #)\n",
